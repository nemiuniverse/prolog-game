# prolog-game
Project for Methods for Knowledge Engineering course.
My idea for the project was designing simple mansion map, placing there people and items - evidences.
One of the people is a murderer and the player must guess who is it.
Player can move across the mansion, talk to people (suspects) and search for the evidences.
Game is over when the murderer is found.
